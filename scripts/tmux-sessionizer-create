# --- Configuration ---
# Add the base directories where you want to create new projects.
# Use full paths. New directories will be created inside the selected one.
# Use printf to handle spaces in paths and ensure one entry per line.

# 3. Construct the full path for the new project directory

# 5. Call the tmux-sessionizer script with the new (or existing) directory path
# This requires `tmux-sessionizer` to be in your $PATH
